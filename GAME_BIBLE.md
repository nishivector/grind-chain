# Grind Chain - Game Bible

## Identity
- **Name:** grind-chain
- **Tagline:** Tap to grind. Never break the chain.
- **What is the player?** A silhouette skater on an endless urban street
- **World feel:** Sunset-drenched urban sprawl where the sky burns orange and the ground is deep purple asphalt. The world scrolls past like a fever dream — beautiful, dangerous, hypnotic.
- **Emotional experience:** The rush of chaining grinds together, the panic of seeing a gap you can't make, the satisfaction of a perfect 8+ chain
- **Reference games:** Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (flow state), Limbo (silhouette aesthetic),Geometry Dash (rhythm and precision)

## Visual DNA
- **Color palette:** Sunset Orange (#FF6B35), Deep Purple (#2D1B4E), Neon Yellow (#E8FF00)
- **Visual reference:** Tony Hawk meets Limbo — clean silhouettes against a dramatic sunset sky
- **Post-processing:** Bloom (intensity 0.4), Vignette (subtle, 0.3)
- **Player silhouette:** Clean black figure, small but visible, dynamic pose

## Sound DNA
- **Music identity:** Driving synth-wave loop with steady beat — think synthwave pulse
- **Music ↔ gameplay:** Music tempo matches scroll speed; intensifies with combo count
- **Key SFX:**
  1. Jump whoosh
  2. Grind lock (satisfying clack)
  3. Combo increment (rhythmic click)
  4. Combo break (dull thud)
  5. High combo fanfare (punchy synth stab)
  6. Game over jingle

## Mechanics
- **Core loop:** Auto-scroll right, tap to jump, tap at peak to grind rails, chain grinds for multiplier
- **The one thing to master:** Timing — jump early enough for elevated rails, tap at peak for every grind
- **Controls:** Single tap (jump), Second tap at peak (grind)
- **Win/lose condition:** Endless — high score based on longest chain; game ends when you hit ground without grinding

## Pro5gression
- ** Levels:**
  1. "First Grind" — Static low rails, forgiving timing
  2. "Elevate" — Higher rails requiring earlier jump
  3. "Gap Year" — Ground patches between rails, longer gaps
  4. "Moving Target" — Rails at varying heights, some moving
  5. "Narrow Edge" — Thin ledges, precision required
- **What changes each level:** Rail patterns, spacing, elevation variance, movement
- **The moment:** When you hit combo 8+ and the screen glows brighter

## World & Lore
- **3-sentence premise:** You're a skater chasing the perfect run through an endless city. Every rail is a chance to extend your chain. Don't touch the ground.
- **Environmental details:** 
  1. Silhouette buildings scroll past in parallax layers
  2. Occasional spray-painted tags on walls (just shapes, no text)
